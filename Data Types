# Fundamental Basic Data Types
* The ranges and sizes of these objects are machine-dependent (32-bit or 64-bit OS)

o Integer Types
> int    - Integer
> short  - Short Integer
> long   - Long Integer

> float  - Floating-Point Numbers
> double - Double Precision Floating-Point

> Char   - Character (a single byte) [typically ASCII Character]


o Integers (int)
The type "int" means that the variables listed are integers

* The range depends on every machine:
In 16-bit ints between -32768 and +32767
In 32-bit ints between -2147483648 and +2147483647 are common


o Floating-Point Numbers (float)
"float" which means floating-point numbers (have a fractional part)

Typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least 6 significant digits
Magnitude generally between about 10^-38 and 10^+38 


o Double Precision Floating-Point (double)
Double the precision thus, double the size...
* because of its size, use it only when necessary (when you need more precision over memory and speed)

Typically a 64-bit quantity (double from "float")
