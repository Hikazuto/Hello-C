============= Compile C Source program ================  
*Just a bit of hint for me

# To compile a C Source Program
type "$gcc {C source file} -o {output name}" in LINUX terminal using GNU Compiler, or
type "$gcc {C source file}" on LINUX, the compiler will automatically named it to "a.out"
type ">cl {C source file}" on Windows using Microsoft built-in "Visual Studio" Compiler terminal
ex: gcc HelloWorld.c -o helloworld.out


NOTE:
 On other systems the rules will be different; Check with a local expert
 You can use GNU compiler in Windows using MinGW (MinGW-w64 or MSYS2) 
 You can also use another compiler

*There are tons of compiler out there (Browse the Internet for more information) 
*Browse the Internet for more information


> The compiler will produce:

 * an executable file (*.exe) and object file (*.obj) on Windows Visual Studio Compiler
 * an executable file (*.exe) on Windows (MinGW Compiler)
 * an executable file (*.out) on UNIX and Linux Operating System [I try it on Manjaro]
 * etc.


# To run the compiled program or executable files
type "./{Executable or object file name}" in terminal

or press F5 or "debug" in your IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
/* Such as "Visual Studio Code", "Visual Studio", "Notepad++", etc */
Then choose your preference debugger to run and instantly see the program output 
(without having to compile it first)
