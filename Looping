There are 3 types of loops:
- While
- For 
- Do

# WHILE LOOP

while (condition)
{
    body
    body
    body
    .
    .
}

The while loop operates as follows:
> First, the condition in the parenthesees is tested
> If the condition is true (1), the body of the loop is executed        
    *The body of the loop is every statements between the curly bracers

> After done, the condition is re-tested, if true, the body is executed again
> Until the condition becomes false (0), the loop ends 
> The program exited the loop and execution continues to the statement that follows after the loop
